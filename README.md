# Pocket-Algorithm

The perceptron algorithm is a simple supervised learning technique used for binary classification tasks. It emulates the functioning of a single neuron, taking input features and outputting a binary decision. Through iterative updates, it adjusts its parameters to correctly classify data points. Despite its simplicity, it forms the basis for more complex neural network architectures and is particularly effective for linearly separable datasets.

Pocket Algorithm is similar to the perceptron algorithm its just the advanced version of the perceptron. Perceptron is jsut for the linearly classifying data, where Pocket algorithm is used when a data is not linearly sepearable and you want to sepreate data with the minimal error
